Statistics project repository to store data (data.js) and manipulate it (index.js)

For this project, I plan to investigate the frequency of the appearance of cards in
the popular mobile game Clash Royale on a per game basis.

The samples will be taken at least three times per hour between 8am and 2am and
within the 3900 - 4000 trophy rating range. For each played match, the opponent’s
eight cards will be noted down, including the card’s level and rarity for future
analysis. The sampling is random within that trophy range since the game handles the
matchmaking portion and I will not be counting the cards that I am playing myself.

My hypothesis is that I will find a portion of about 60% of the 70 available cards
(as of march 2017) be played significantly more than the other 40% and that within
the 60%, there will be a close to even distribution of the cards being played. I
also predict variations in card frequency throughout the day to reflect the different
preferred playing patterns from different countries in the world. The last part of
my hypothesis is that average card level per rarity will be the following:
legendary (2), epic (4.5), rare(8.5), common(11.5).
